libdex 0.6.1
============

 * Adds Fiber support for macOS on Apple Silicon

libdex 0.6.0
============

This is a stable release for GNOME 46

 * No changes since 0.5.1

libdex 0.5.1
============

 * Add convenience API for checking exact future status without enum
 * Lots of documentation additions

libdex 0.5.0
============

This is a beta release for GNOME 46.

 * Various API now warns about unused results to help avoid unintended
   leaks of futures.
 * dex_file_query_exists() is a new wrapper for g_file_query_exists()
 * Documentation fixes

libdex 0.4.3
============

This release contains a few more followup fixes for fallback scheduling,
particularly on Linux systems without io_uring. We've also enabled CI
to test this situation more closely as we're most likely to run into it
on distribution build systems running older Linux kernels.

 * New build options for disabling io_uring and eventfd support which
   enable testing more fallback paths in CI.
 * Worker threads will now use a GMainLoop instead iterating GMainContext
   manually.
 * An idle is used for scheduling work items directly onto a worker thread
   instead of going through the global work queue when not already running
   on a worker thread. Otherwise the lock-free work queue is used.
 * A fix for a potential deadlock when failing to create an additional
   worker thread.
 * Fix a release build warning.

libdex 0.4.2
============

This release contains an important fix for running on systems with
io_uring and recent Linux kernels.

 * io_uring AIO backend will now attempt to create the io_uring on the
   target worker thread so that IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER may restrict
   submissions correctly.
 * Linux distributions may optionally disable liburing using the build
   time option -Dliburing=disabled. In that case, the fallback of POSIX
   IO with a thread-pool will be used.

libdex 0.4.1
============

This release includes an important fix for how io_uring CQE are handled.

libdex 0.4.0
============

This is the release for GNOME 45.

Changes in this release:

 * Documentation fix

libdex 0.3.1
============

This is the beta release for GNOME 45.

Changes in this release:

 * A new "Infinite" future type which will never resolve or reject.
 * The gio wrappers will now set debuggable names for their futures.
 * A `dex_async_pair_set_cancel_on_discard()` function has been added which
   ensures that the `GCancellable` will not be cancelled when the future
   is discarded. This can help in situations where you might repeatedly
   await on a future and do not want intermediate cancellation between
   attempts to await.
 * A `dex_input_stream_skip_async()` function has been added to wrap the
   underlying GIO function.
 * A `dex_future_disown()` function has been added which simplifies the
   case where you want a future to run but are not interested in the result.

libdex 0.3.0
============

This is the first alpha release for GNOME 45.

Changes in this release:

 * Documentation updates
 * pkg-config improvements
 * Build system improvements for GIR
 * Support for GVariant-based futures
 * New Future-based wrappers for GDBusConnection
 * The FD-based AIO API is now public, allowing for use of io_uring
   on Linux kernels that support it. If unsupported, a threadpool
   approach is used similar to GIO.
 * Improvements to introspection for language bindings.
 * You can now return NULL for a DexPromise expecting a GObject as
   as a resolved value.
 * DexFiber will now get static names associated with them when
   used from C which points to the line of code. This is only enabled
   when debugging is enabled for libdex through the use of macros.

libdex 0.2.0
============

This is the first release intended for end-users.

Changes in this release:

 * Followup fixes for building on mips
 * Fixes for introspection gi-scanner
 * Remove abstract type flag from DexFuture to satisfy GObject Introspection
   rules about constructors.
 * Many documentation/gi-annotation fixes
 * Build system improvements
 * Default to `-Dintrospection=enabled`

libdex 0.1.1
============

Changes in this release:

 * Fix soname versioning
 * Documentation improvements
 * Fix various GObject Introspection issues
 * More backports for older GLib use
 * Various ucontext fiber fixes for less-used architectures
 * Fixes for various incorrect cast-align warnings
 * Tweaks for better Forward portability
 * Add some missing g_autoptr() definitions
 * Add GCancellation integration to DexPromise

libdex 0.1.0
============

This is an initial release of libdex meant for experimentation and testing.
