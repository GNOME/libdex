libdex 0.3.1
============

This is the beta release for GNOME 45.

Changes in this release:

 * A new "Infinite" future type which will never resolve or reject.
 * The gio wrappers will now set debuggable names for their futures.
 * A `dex_async_pair_set_cancel_on_discard()` function has been added which
   ensures that the `GCancellable` will not be cancelled when the future
   is discarded. This can help in situations where you might repeatedly
   await on a future and do not want intermediate cancellation between
   attempts to await.
 * A `dex_input_stream_skip_async()` function has been added to wrap the
   underlying GIO function.
 * A `dex_future_disown()` function has been added which simplifies the
   case where you want a future to run but are not interested in the result.

libdex 0.3.0
============

This is the first alpha release for GNOME 45.

Changes in this release:

 * Documentation updates
 * pkg-config improvements
 * Build system improvements for GIR
 * Support for GVariant-based futures
 * New Future-based wrappers for GDBusConnection
 * The FD-based AIO API is now public, allowing for use of io_uring
   on Linux kernels that support it. If unsupported, a threadpool
   approach is used similar to GIO.
 * Improvements to introspection for language bindings.
 * You can now return NULL for a DexPromise expecting a GObject as
   as a resolved value.
 * DexFiber will now get static names associated with them when
   used from C which points to the line of code. This is only enabled
   when debugging is enabled for libdex through the use of macros.

libdex 0.2.0
============

This is the first release intended for end-users.

Changes in this release:
