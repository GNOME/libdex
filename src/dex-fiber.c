/**
 * DexFiber:
 *
 * #DexFiber is a fiber (a stack-based coroutine) which itself is a #DexFuture.
 *
 * When the fiber completes execution it will either resolve or reject the
 * with the result or error.
 *
 * You may treat a #DexFiber like any other #DexFuture which makes it simple
 * to integrate fibers into other processing chains.
 *
 * #DexFiber are provided their own stack seperate from a threads main stack,
 * They are automatically scheduled as necessary.
 *
 * Use dex_await() and similar functions to await the result of another future
 * within the fiber and the fiber will be suspended allowing another fiber to
 * run and/or the rest of the applications main loop.
 *
 * Once a fiber is created, it is pinned to that scheduler. Use
 * dex_scheduler_spawn() to create a fiber on a specific scheduler.
